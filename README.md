# Hello-World
This is my first step in creating anything online.
I am a mid-20s adult looking to break into the cyber world and utilize it for the greater good. I also wish to use it as a secondary source or even primary source of income by learning how to do what is required for cyber jobs.
I love the flexibility that being online offers and as it the way of the future I do not want to be left behind. 
I am a long time worker in the public safety sector. So heres to a brighter future and all the fun the internet can provide. 
Side note I am studying this alongside real estate so I can optimize my future and have more freedom. We all deserve freedom and to have access to the resources the web offers.
This is amazing!!!!
Thanks Dave (You know who you are)
